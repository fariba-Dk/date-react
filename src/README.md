### Things to do:

1. Make the form work!
2. At the bare minimum, your form should console.log all the values for a new registration
3. If you feel that you have time, show registration values in a success message to the user (just as text)
4. Extra bonus: Make a component for the success message and render it after the submit onclick()
5. Extra bonus and kudos: If you have time, feel free to add more css to the new message or component
